The `s9xxx-v*-openwrt_*.img` is the general OpenWrt firmware of `s9xxx series boxs`. You can write this OpenWrt firmware to the `USB hard disk` to start. When writing into EMMC through [s9xxx-install.sh](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/install-program/files/s9xxx-install.sh), `select the name` of the box you own in the menu.

For more OpenWrt firmware .dtb files are in the [dtb-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/armbian/dtb-amlogic) directory. You can use the `s9xxx-v*-openwrt_*.img` firmware to install via USB hard disk. When writing into EMMC through [s9xxx-install.sh](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/install-program/files/s9xxx-install.sh), [select 0: Enter the dtb file name of your box](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/armbian/dtb-amlogic), and use the S9xxx-Boxs you own.
